Search in Pacman
===========

This is my CS188 Project 1.

In this project, there is Pacman agent who will find paths through his maze world, both to reach a particular location and to collect food efficiently. I have build general search algorithms and applied them to Pacman scenarios. 

In this project basically i am Implementing breadth-first search, depth-first search, a* search, as well as making use of heuristics.

For more information about the project please refer <a href=http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/fa11/projects/search/search.html>here</a> to the CS188 official website.
